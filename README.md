# HTML Beginner Project
This is a fun and simple starter project for the HTML workshop at CedarTech. In this project, we created a webpage to showcase our favorite movies. We covered the basics of HTML structure.

## Topics Covered

- Basic HTML structure
- HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
- Embedding images

## Project Overview

In this project, we built a webpage titled "My Favorite Movies" which includes:

- A list of top 3 favorite movies
- Sample pictures of the movies
- Links to more information about each movie

This project serves as a foundation for building more complex web pages and applications. Happy coding!
